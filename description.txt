Journey's Trend: The Community Vanity Mod

You heard it: over 7,000 entries, 431 Semi-Finalists, 25 Finalists, but just 5 winners?

Since there were so many downright awesome contest entries, we decided to make a mod for as many of those as we could.
We asked many, many Contestants and expected maybe 20 of them to give us their permission for this mod.

At this point in time we have over 90 permissions for sets to add to our mod.
And 7 of those 90 are our beloved finalists.

Each set can be aquired in their own unique way, some are easier and some are harder to get you hands on.
But, to reduce the grind, we have also implemented a new NPC that will gladly sell you any set you are missing in your collection.
Though you might need to rid his way from cosmological threats in order for him to travel your way.


This Mod is a pure vanity mod and will not influence game progression whatsoever.
This should ensure compability with every other mod there is.
Every Set is 100% in accordance with the creator.
Only sets from the official Community Vanity Contest are part of this mod.
