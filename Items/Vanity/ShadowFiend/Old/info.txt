Shadow Fiend Helmet - Cursed Flames consume you!; Made by CakeBoiii
Shadow Fiend Breastplate - Cursed Flames consume you!; Made by CakeBoiii
Shadow Fiend Leggings - Cursed Flames consume you!; Made by CakeBoiii

this set should have a visual effect similar to the meteor armor's trail of flames,
but the same color as the cursed flames, and with less particles

how should it look:
	Shadow Fiend Helmet
	Equipable
	Vanity Item
	Cursed Flames consume you!
	Made by CakeBoiii
