Credited as: "Dusk Ealain" 

Method of obtaining:
- TBD (Designer is unlikely to respond, Consult community for method?)

Rarity Colour: TBD

Additional Info:

- The spritesheet labelled as "New Shoulder Flame" if implemented will need the "Knight walker dust particles" added to it.
- The helmet will need the player's head to be hidden.
- Self-explanatory but; Idle Cape animation is to be played while the player is still and the Running cape animation is to be played while the player is moving.
