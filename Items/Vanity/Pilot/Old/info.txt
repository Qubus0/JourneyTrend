Hello there,

Good to hear! The set item names are as follows:
- Pilot's Cap (head)
- Pilot's Jumpsuit (body, visually covers legs)
The names would be in Light Red rarity.

Tooltip for the Cap would preferably be "Still some wyvern saliva in the goggles, but otherwise
surprisingly intact."
Tooltip for the Jumpsuit would preferably be "Parachute not included."

Ideally, I'd like the set to be obtained from Wyvern drops at a high drop rate, let's say 1 in 3.
I'd prefer if it was a guaranteed drop for one piece, but it's fine if that's too difficult to work with.

As for the name to give credit to, CyrantontheCold works fine.
