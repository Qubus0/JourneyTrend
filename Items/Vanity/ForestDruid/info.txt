-The legs are intentionally left blank, didn't know if you need those. These sprites for the robes act like the Reaper's robe, so they have no legs.
-The Forest Druid's Horns are the main head piece and Hood and Mask are the alternative designs (Kohi might still want to change the names of the two alternates).
-Kohi might still want to add tooltips
