Could it have dust 226 as a trail? Stationary and not affected by
gravity. The wings should be like the jetpack but fly as high as
the harpy wings.

There is a treasure bag that drops from enemies in space:

 - Wyvern: 5%
 - Harpy: 1%
 - Other: 0.25%

Other means any other mob that is killed in space.
Also, statues will work for this. Harpy statues count toward Harpy.

*** Note: Balloon and Pack are not going to be added at this point in time, to keep in line with the contest submissions (this may change at a later date, post-release)
*** Note: Drops from all mobs in space at 0.25% chance is not possible due to bugs, especially with other mods. May be possible to add back at a later date.
