There will be some Greek Mythology references when it comes to the set due to its name.
The name of the set items will be simple though:
-Andromeda Pilot Helmet
-Andromeda Pilot Breastplate
-Cetus

The tooltips for both helmet and breastplate would be "Let there be a constellation with your name on it" while
Cetus' tooltip would be "Those chains really don't suit you"

The helmet and breastplate could have a guaranteed drop chance from Medusa if the player is wearing
Hermes Boots as a reference to Perseus.
The leggings could be a drop from Duke Fishron as a reference to the sea monster sent by
Poseidon who was meant to devour Andromeda.
