Spriter's comments:
1-the female armor legs are different
2-the author hasn't informed what the name of each set piece is, nor their respective descriptons
3-the drawn image presented by the author shows a scarf, while the sprite presented a cape - I went with the scarf
4-the author hasn't informed how the set should be obtained as well, so I went with something until the author give an answer
5-I absolutely loved this design (tho I hated spriting the scarf), I'm jealous I didn't came up with this first XD
