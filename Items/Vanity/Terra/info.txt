Spriter's comments:
1-the female armor legs are different
2-the crown must show the player's hair, like the vanilla crown
3-this set was previously sprited by Chan, but I had to do some recoloring, respriting, etc.
4-personally, I think there's just TOO MUCH unnecessary description for the pieces, but the author wanted it this way so I don't even care anymore...
5-also, I think the drop rates for this set makes it TOO common, then again, that's the author's choice, so I don't care
