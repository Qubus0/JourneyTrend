Dune Scorpion Helm: [A vicious looking visor, but mostly just keeps the sun out of your eyes]
Dune Scorpion Chestplate: [It's sturdy looking exoskeleton armor but... maybe layer up just in case]
Dune Scorpion Leggings: [Useful for chitin enemies!]
Dune Scorpion Tail: [Not as venomous as you might think, but intimidating nonetheless]

Credited as: "[Thorrin]" 

Method of obtaining:
[Each piece can be crafted with 2 Black Scorpions (maybe three for the tail) at a Dye Vat or Loom or Anvil, whatever makes more sense. 
The bag itself is a rare drop (maybe 1/200) from Sand Poachers]

Rarity Colour: [Pink]

Additional Info:

[Tail of the sprite is extended a bit and is intended to be layered behind the player. Not tested with the jump animation, so may need to be extended more to not look weird.
Should be an easy fix, just let me know if that's the case, and I'll address it.]
